How it works:
#include <stdio.h> — Imports the standard input/output library for printf() and fprintf().
printf() — Prints "Hello, World!" followed by a newline (\n).
Error Handling — Checks if printf() fails (rare, but possible in low-level I/O errors).
return 0; — Indicates successful program termination.
Compilation & Execution:
Bash

Copy code
gcc hello.c -o hello   # Compile
./hello                # Run
?? If you want, I can also show you 3 alternative ways to print "Hello, World!" in C, including without printf().
Do you want me to include those?
